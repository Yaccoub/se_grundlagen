# gdp (Grundlagen der Programmierung)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and example data for my
course *Grundlagen der Programmierung* at Graz University. All notebooks are in German.

## Usage

To use the notebooks make sure you have these programs installed:

* Python version 3. 
* Jupyter. Install it via package manager or via pip or conda (`pip install jupyter` or `conda install jupyter` if you use Conda/Anaconda)

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gvasold/gdp.git
```

Then change into `gdp` directory and start the Jupyter server:

```bash
cd gdp
jupyter notebook
```

This will bring up your browser and will show you the contents of the `gdp` directory.

All notebooks have numbers (like `01_datentypen.ipynb`). I suggest to use the notebooks in this order. Notebooks are organized by topics. Each topic has its own folder. Start with folder `grundlagen`.
